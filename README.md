# ⚡ VelocityForge Engine

> *Next-generation, modular game engine built for speed, creativity, and real-time rendering innovation*

---

## 🎮 Overview

**VelocityForge** is a lightweight, high-performance game engine designed from the ground up for modern game development. Built with a modular architecture and real-time rendering at its core, VelocityForge empowers developers to create stunning 2D and 3D experiences without the overhead of monolithic engines.

Whether you're prototyping an indie game, building a simulation, or experimenting with cutting-edge graphics techniques, VelocityForge provides the tools and flexibility you need. Its component-based entity system, optimized rendering pipeline, and intuitive API make it the perfect choice for developers who value both performance and creative control.

**What makes VelocityForge revolutionary?**

VelocityForge deviates from conventional engine design by giving developer experience and modularity top priority.  Because each subsystem—from rendering to physics—is independently swappable and decoupled, you can tailor the engine to your precise requirements.  VelocityForge is designed with the future of game development in mind, emphasizing modern C++ techniques, quick compilation times, and minimal dependencies.

## 🚀 Usage Example

Here's how to create a simple scene with a rotating cube using VelocityForge:
```cpp
#include <VelocityForge/Engine.h>
#include <VelocityForge/Components/Transform.h>
#include <VelocityForge/Components/MeshRenderer.h>

int main() {
    // Initialize the engine
    vf::Engine engine;
    engine.Initialize(1280, 720, "VelocityForge Demo");

    // Create a scene
    auto scene = engine.CreateScene("MainScene");

    // Create an entity with a cube mesh
    auto cubeEntity = scene->CreateEntity("RotatingCube");
    cubeEntity->AddComponent();
    cubeEntity->AddComponent("models/cube.obj", "shaders/pbr.glsl");

    // Add rotation behavior
    engine.OnUpdate([&](float deltaTime) {
        auto transform = cubeEntity->GetComponent();
        transform->Rotate(glm::vec3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f), deltaTime * 50.0f);
    });

    // Start the game loop
    engine.Run();

    return 0;
}
```
